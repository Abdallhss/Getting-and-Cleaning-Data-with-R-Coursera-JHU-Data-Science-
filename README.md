# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-with-R-Coursera-JHU-Data-Science

This is part of the Getting and Cleaning Data course, one of the courses in the JHU Data science specialization on Coursera.
In this project, we use the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set from UCI.
The data is highly clean. It just need to be combined together as requested. The process flow was as follows
1) First, the train and test data sets are prepared by combining features and labels data frames and renaming if neccessary.
2) The train and test data were then combined and uncessary columns were dropped to include on data on the mean and std.
3) A pipe line was created to group the data with the activity and subject and calucate the mean of all features.
